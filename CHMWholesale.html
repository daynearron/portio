                Commerce Home Mortgage Wholesale values new perspectives and creative ideas
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Commerce Home Mortgage Wholesale aspires to treat wholesale lending with a start-up mentality, by constantly re-evaluating antiquated processes full of red tape and rigid structure that slows down big banks, bringing fresh new ideas and experiences to their clients.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Commerce Home Mortgage wanted to elevate their wholesale channel. After our initial brief, we discussed possible routes and solutions. We reflected on areas they felt needed refining. After a few discussions and meetings we determined that we needed to:

                    day-to-day workflow of key employees.

                Maintaining a great workflow
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                As a group, having worked on the parent company Commerce Home Mortgage Retail, we maintained our original functions.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Once again, I switched contexts between UI designer, UX researcher, visual designer, front end developer, performing marketing research, as well as managing the company’s social media presence in tandem with the lead designer, Robin.

                Divide and Conquer
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                We got started by assigning tasks based on individual strengths. I began with interviewing and shadowing primary stakeholders seeking qualitative data on the current procedures to identify pain points and exploring possible solutions.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                I found the day-to-day of a mortgage advisory very
                <i>active.</i>
                Running from meeting to meeting with clients and stakeholders, tons of emailing, and reaching out to clients via telephone. After reviewing all of my notes I hypothesized that the following pain points could be remedied:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Broker Forms
                    </strong>
                    The lengthiest part of a brokers day-to-day is completing a Broker Agreement Package, a document containing all the necessary forms needed to move forward on submitting a loan. This could take 35 minutes to an hour to complete.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Turn times
                    </strong>
                    Normally a broker would need to reach out to several different sources to get the turn-around times for specific functions.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Rate-Sheets
                    </strong>
                    Brokers rely on excel documents to find the most suitable Loan Program for their client, because these are excel documents that need to be updated daily it became a nightmare for version control plus they can be quite lengthy.
                  </p>
                </li>

                      Marketing Materials
                    </strong>
                    Per information obtained through the marketing VP, we found email and print campaigns have helped generate millions in originated loans but the process of creating customized collateral was inconvenient.
                  </p>

              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Once our foundational research had been completed we met with Kristie Berg, the VP of Marketing, to share our findings and to formulate the best approach. We whiteboarded a few strategies on how to solve the priorities that Kristie felt needed to be addressed. We decided on the following:
