                Commerce Home Mortgage Wholesale values new perspectives and creative ideas
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Commerce Home Mortgage Wholesale aspires to treat wholesale lending with a start-up mentality, by constantly re-evaluating antiquated processes full of red tape and rigid structure that slows down big banks, bringing fresh new ideas and experiences to their clients.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Commerce Home Mortgage wanted to elevate their wholesale channel. After our initial brief, we discussed possible routes and solutions. We reflected on areas they felt needed refining. After a few discussions and meetings we determined that we needed to:

                Maintaining a great workflow
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                As a group, having worked on the parent company Commerce Home Mortgage Retail, we maintained our original functions.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Once again, I switched contexts between UI designer, UX researcher, visual designer, front end developer, performing marketing research, as well as managing the companyâ€™s social media presence in tandem with the lead designer, Robin.

                Divide and Conquer
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                We got started by assigning tasks based on individual strengths. I began with interviewing and shadowing primary stakeholders seeking qualitative data on the current procedures to identify pain points and exploring possible solutions.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                I found the day-to-day of a mortgage advisory very
                <i>active.</i>
                Running from meeting to meeting with clients and stakeholders, tons of emailing, and reaching out to clients via telephone. After reviewing all of my notes I hypothesized that the following pain points could be remedied:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Broker Forms
                    </strong>
                    The lengthiest part of a brokers day-to-day is completing a Broker Agreement Package, a document containing all the necessary forms needed to move forward on submitting a loan. This could take 35 minutes to an hour to complete.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Turn times
                    </strong>
                    Normally a broker would need to reach out to several different sources to get the turn-around times for specific functions.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Rate-Sheets
                    </strong>
                    Brokers rely on excel documents to find the most suitable Loan Program for their client, because these are excel documents that need to be updated daily it became a nightmare for version control plus they can be quite lengthy.
                  </p>
                </li>

                      Marketing Materials
                    </strong>
                    Per information obtained through the marketing VP, we found email and print campaigns have helped generate millions in originated loans but the process of creating customized collateral was inconvenient.
                  </p>

              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Once our foundational research had been completed we met with Kristie Berg, the VP of Marketing, to share our findings and to formulate the best approach. We whiteboarded a few strategies on how to solve the priorities that Kristie felt needed to be addressed. We decided on the following:
