                My position included switching contexts between UI designer, UX researcher, visual designer, and front end developer.

              <p class='intro-copy'>
                I also performed marketing research, as well as managing the company’s social media presence. With each of us playing multiple roles, communication was vital for progress; decisions needed to be conveyed to everyone constantly.

                With team members working remotely, living on different coasts—and even different countries—we communicated with each other effectively through Google Hangouts, Skype and email. We tracked our progress and organized tasks with Trello and a project tracker developed in-house.

              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Because our team comprised mostly of external vendors and contractors, the best way to get started was to immerse ourselves to better understand the mortgage process.

              <p class='intro-copy'>
                Interviews with the marketing team had a wealth of information for us, but to get to the core we shadowed the day-to-day workflow of a loan officer—the main point of contact for anyone seeking a loan.

              <p class='intro-copy'>
                We sat down with 3 loan officers and interviewed them about key aspects of their workflow and client interactions for 30 minutes each. We discussed the following topics:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>

                    <br>
                    How were they recruited? Have they recruited anyone? What brought them to Commerce?

                <li>

                    <br>
                    What are some of the major concerns clients have? How do they ensure they are providing the client with the best answer possible? What do their clients value? What have they gotten feedback on per their client. What questions are they frequently being asked?

                    How they communicate with their clients and other brokers? How are they currently marketing themselves to get new leads? What do they need help with? How is the current marketing system working for them. What were the current pain points in existing system and how it affects their day-to-day?

                    What excited them about Commerce? What could be improved? What they thought was the biggest obstacles in their daily routine?

                Organizing a plan of action
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                When our foundational research was complete, I organized the information identifying the biggest pain-points in addition to what was working well in the current system.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                As the team synthesized our data, we found several key areas that needed to be improved: visibility of loan officers to new leads, communication between the clients and officers, and simplifying information that borrowers frequently requested.
              </p>
              <h2>
                Putting the pieces together to find a better solution
              </h2>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                After our analysis, we broke the project into several pieces: a refreshed client facing website, a brand new communication and marketing tool for loan officers, and a separate recruiting website to draw in more talent.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                We began with the biggest requirement: giving the website an overhaul that would make it easier for existing and future clients to use. We broke down the mortgage process into smaller digestible bites, quickly iterating through several versions of user flows and wireframes.
              </p>
              <p class='intro-copy'>
                We continuously vetted prototypes with Commerce Home Mortgage loan officers, the marketing team, and several other employees in the multiple different departments. Our final design showcases the loan officer, and the culture at Commerce Home Mortgage with a refreshed brand that’s friendly and accessible.
