            <p class='intro-copy'>
              Because our team comprised mostly of external vendors and contractors, the best way to get started was to immerse ourselves to better understand the mortgage process. Interviews with the marketing team had a wealth of information for us, but to get to the core we shadowed the day-to-day workflow of a loan officer—the main point of contact for anyone seeking a loan.

            <p class='intro-copy'>
              After the loan officer interviews were complete, my team decided to get another important perspective:
              <strong>
                the borrower’s.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p class='intro-copy'>
              Regulations and privacy concerns prevented us from contacting any borrowers directly; luckily, some of the Commerce Home Mortgage staff had gone through Commerce for a loan so we were able to use them as a proto persona with the understanding it may not exactly map to the casual applicant.
            </p>
            <p class='intro-copy'>
              We interviewed them about their experience the company’s current process. We wanted to know what frustrated them, but also what delighted them.

            </p>
            <p class='intro-copy'>
              We began with the biggest requirement: giving the website an overhaul that would make it easier for existing and future clients to use. We broke down the mortgage process into smaller digestible bites, quickly iterating through several versions of user flows and wireframes.
            </p>
            <p class='intro-copy'>
              We continuously vetted prototypes with Commerce Home Mortgage loan officers, the marketing team, and several other employees in the multiple different departments. Our final design showcases the loan officer, and the culture at Commerce Home Mortgage with a refreshed brand that’s friendly and accessible.

            Challenges & Solutions
          </h2>
          <p class='intro-copy'>
            The different time zones and the lack of in-person meetings Lead to a decline in productivity. If one team member had a question then they would have to wait until the next day to get a response. To tackle this, we convinced our project manager at Commerce Home Mortgage to use Trello as a project management tool to delegate all design and testing tasks as these were being delivered through emails. This gave us the ability to track project progress on a distributed team, making it easier for one of us to pick up where another had left off. We also segregated all development feedback into a separate issue-tracker; this helped manage the delegation of front-end and back end tasks and set expectations for when tasks could be completed.
          </p>
          <p class='intro-copy'>
            Issue tracking, version control, and communication tools, such as slack, are all tools that enhance a team environment.
