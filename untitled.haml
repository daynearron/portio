            -#     As the team synthesized our data, we found several key areas that needed to be improved: visibility of loan officers to new leads, communication between the clients and officers, and simplifying information that borrowers frequently requested.

            -#   %p.intro-copy 
            -#     After our analysis, we broke the project into several pieces: a refreshed client facing website, a brand new communication and marketing tool for loan officers, and a separate recruiting website to draw in more talent. 
            -#   %p.intro-copy 
            -#     We began with the biggest requirement: giving the website an overhaul that would make it easier for existing and future clients to use. We broke down the mortgage process into smaller digestible bites, quickly iterating through several versions of user flows and wireframes. 
            -#   %p.intro-copy 
            -#     We continuously vetted prototypes with Commerce Home Mortgage loan officers, the marketing team, and several other employees in the multiple different departments. Our final design showcases the loan officer, and the culture at Commerce Home Mortgage with a refreshed brand that’s friendly and accessible.
