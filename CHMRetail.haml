              Headquartered in San Ramon, California and originally founded in 1994 by Simonich Corporation and Bank of Walnut Creek, Commerce Home Mortgage aspires to simplify the application process for potential clients, streamlining  recruitment, and providing those employees with the right tools needed to thrive.

              I also performed marketing research, as well as managing the company’s social media presence. With each of us playing multiple roles, communication was vital for progress; decisions needed to be conveyed to everyone constantly.

              With team members working remotely, living on different coasts—and even different countries—we communicated with each other effectively through Google Hangouts, Skype and email. We tracked our progress and organized tasks with Trello and a project tracker developed in-house.

              by way of immersion
            %p.intro-copy
              Because our team comprised mostly of external vendors and contractors, the best way to get started was to immerse ourselves to better understand the mortgage process. Interviews with the marketing team had a wealth of information for us, but to get to the core we shadowed the day-to-day workflow of a loan officer—the main point of contact for anyone seeking a loan.

              Proto personas
            %p.intro-copy
              After the loan officer interviews were complete, my team decided to get another important perspective: 
              %strong 
                the borrower’s. 
            %p.intro-copy
              Regulations and privacy concerns prevented us from contacting any borrowers directly; luckily, some of the Commerce Home Mortgage staff had gone through Commerce for a loan so we were able to use them as a proto persona with the understanding it may not exactly map to the casual applicant.
            %p.intro-copy
              We interviewed them about their experience the company’s current process. We wanted to know what frustrated them, but also what delighted them.

            %p.intro-copy
              Our next step was to  review sites such as Yelp, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram, searching for positive and negative reviews of Commerce Home Mortgage and also of its competitors.

              Organizing a plan of action
            %p.intro-copy    
              When our foundational research was complete, I organized the information identifying the biggest pain-points in addition to what was working well in the current system. As the team synthesized our data, we found several key areas that needed to be improved: visibility of loan officers to new leads, communication between the clients and officers, and simplifying information that borrowers frequently requested. The organization also lacked an effective way to recruit new top talent.

              Putting the pieces together to find a better solution
            %p.intro-copy 
              After our analysis, we broke the project into several pieces: a refreshed client facing website, a brand new communication and marketing tool for loan officers, and a separate recruiting website to draw in more talent. 
            %p.intro-copy 
              We began with the biggest requirement: giving the website an overhaul that would make it easier for existing and future clients to use. We broke down the mortgage process into smaller digestible bites, quickly iterating through several versions of user flows and wireframes. 
            %p.intro-copy 
              We continuously vetted prototypes with Commerce Home Mortgage loan officers, the marketing team, and several other employees in the multiple different departments. Our final design showcases the loan officer, and the culture at Commerce Home Mortgage with a refreshed brand that’s friendly and accessible.
