                Headquartered in San Ramon, California and originally founded in 1994 by Simonich Corporation and Bank of Walnut Creek, Commerce Home Mortgage aspires to simplify the application process for potential clients, streamlining  recruitment, and providing those employees with the right tools needed to thrive.

                My position included switching contexts between UI designer, UX researcher, visual designer, and front end developer.
              %p.intro-copy
                I also performed marketing research, as well as managing the company’s social media presence. With each of us playing multiple roles, communication was vital for progress; decisions needed to be conveyed to everyone constantly.
              %p.intro-copy
                With team members working remotely, living on different coasts—and even different countries—we communicated with each other effectively through Google Hangouts, Skype and email. We tracked our progress and organized tasks with Trello and a project tracker developed in-house.

                Creating a solid foundation by way of immersion
              %p.intro-copy
                Because our team comprised mostly of external vendors and contractors, the best way to get started was to immerse ourselves to better understand the mortgage process. 
              %p.intro-copy
                Interviews with the marketing team had a wealth of information for us, but to get to the core we shadowed the day-to-day workflow of a loan officer—the main point of contact for anyone seeking a loan.

                Getting real insight
              %p.intro-copy
                We sat down with 3 loan officers and interviewed them about key aspects of their workflow and client interactions for 30 minutes each. We discussed the following topics:

                Organizing a plan of action
              %p.intro-copy    
                When our foundational research was complete, I organized the information identifying the biggest pain-points in addition to what was working well in the current system. 
              %p.intro-copy 
                As the team synthesized our data, we found several key areas that needed to be improved: visibility of loan officers to new leads, communication between the clients and officers, and simplifying information that borrowers frequently requested. 
              -# %p.intro-copy 
              -#   The organization also lacked an effective way to recruit new top talent.
              %h2
                Putting the pieces together to find a better solution
              %p.intro-copy 
                After our analysis, we broke the project into several pieces: a refreshed client facing website, a brand new communication and marketing tool for loan officers, and a separate recruiting website to draw in more talent. 
              %p.intro-copy 
                We began with the biggest requirement: giving the website an overhaul that would make it easier for existing and future clients to use. We broke down the mortgage process into smaller digestible bites, quickly iterating through several versions of user flows and wireframes. 
              %p.intro-copy 
                We continuously vetted prototypes with Commerce Home Mortgage loan officers, the marketing team, and several other employees in the multiple different departments. Our final design showcases the loan officer, and the culture at Commerce Home Mortgage with a refreshed brand that’s friendly and accessible.
